The GUIBuilder Utility has been selected in the run-time environment of this project.

For convenience it is recommended to add the GUIBuilder utility to the Tools menu of uVision:
1. Open Tools->Customize Tools Menu.
2. Add a new menu item called GUIBuilder.
3. Set the following settings:
    Command:         .\RTE\Graphics\GUIBuilder.exe
    Initial Folder:  .\
    Arguments:
4. Tick the "Run independent" checkbox.

This setup only needs to be done once and will be available globally for all projects.

Now GUIBuilder can be called from Tools->GUIBuilder.
Generated C source files will be stored in the project root folder.

Note: You can customize the output folder in the .\RTE\Graphics\GUIBuilder.ini file.
