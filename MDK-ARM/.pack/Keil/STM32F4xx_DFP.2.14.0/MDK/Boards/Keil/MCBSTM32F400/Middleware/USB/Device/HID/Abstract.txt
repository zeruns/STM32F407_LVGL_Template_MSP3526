This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Board:                  Keil  'MCBSTM32F400'
Microcontroller:        ST       'STM32F407'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB FS CLK =  48 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
User Interface (USBFS): inputs:  WAKEUP button
                        outputs: PH3, PH6, PH7 and PI10 LEDs
User Interface (USBHS): inputs:  TAMPER and USER buttons
                        outputs: PG6, PG7, PG8 and PH2 LEDs

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LEDs and
push buttons can be accessed from the PC through a custom
HID Client Program (.\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Enabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source
   - USB:CORE:                  Debug
 - Release:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Disabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
   - USB:CORE:                  Release
