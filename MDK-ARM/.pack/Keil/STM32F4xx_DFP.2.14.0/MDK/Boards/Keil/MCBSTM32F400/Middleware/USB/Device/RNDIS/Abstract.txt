This is an RNDIS (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) example that 
demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC) Abstract Control Model (ACM) on 
USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between USB RNDIS network adapter and Ethernet port 
on the evaluation board.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_cdc_acm_rndis_bridge.html

Board:                  Keil  'MCBSTM32F400'
Microcontroller:        ST       'STM32F407'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
Bridge functionality:   USBHS <->  <-> ETH

The Windows PC will install a network adapter on automatically if device
is enabled on high-speed port otherwise see Driver Installation below.
After installation an additional network adapter "Keil USB Remote NDIS6 based Device"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Network adapters.

Testing the USB RNDIS network adapter:

  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to USBHS connector on the embedded board.
  Connect local network to ETH connector on the embedded board.
  Disable any other network adapter except "Keil USB Remote NDIS6 based Device".
  Try surfing the web.

Note:
  - MCBSTM32F400 V1.2: KSZ8081RNA Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       KSZ8081RNA CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY is preselected.
  - MCBSTM32F400 V1.1: ST802RT1 Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       Change selection of CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY in
                       the Run-Time Environment window to ST802RT1.
