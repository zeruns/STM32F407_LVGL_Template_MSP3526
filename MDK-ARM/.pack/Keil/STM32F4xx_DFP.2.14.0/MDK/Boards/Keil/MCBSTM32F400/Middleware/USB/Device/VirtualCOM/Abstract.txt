This is an Virtual COM example that demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC)
Abstract Control Model (ACM) on USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between USB Virtual COM Port and UART port on the
evaluation board.

Board:                  Keil  'MCBSTM32F400'
Microcontroller:        ST       'STM32F407'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB FS CLK =  48 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
Bridge functionality:   USBFS <-> UART1 (set jumpers J13 and J14 accordingly)
                        USBHS <-> UART3 (set jumpers J13 and J14 accordingly)

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCBSTM32F400 USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different
"x" displayed in the device manager. The USB Host driver assigns "x"
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration in the system.

Testing the USB Virtual COM Port:

  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to USBFS/USBHS connector on the embedded board.
  Connect PC UART Port with UART cable to UART1/3/4 connector on the embedded board.
  Open two Serial Terminal applications in Windows:
    -  one with "MCBSTM32F400 USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
    -  one with PC UART Port
  Data sent from one Serial Terminal application should be received in other and vice versa.

The program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Enabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source
   - USB:CORE:                  Debug
 - Release:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Disabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
   - USB:CORE:                  Release

Important Note: MCBSTM32F400 does not have routed flow control pins on the UART
                so it is possible that this example will loose characters
                because of not using flow control
