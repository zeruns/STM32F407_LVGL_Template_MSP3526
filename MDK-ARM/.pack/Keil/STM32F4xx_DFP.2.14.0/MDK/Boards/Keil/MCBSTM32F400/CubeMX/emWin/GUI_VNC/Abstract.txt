This is a GUI and VNC Server example.

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP server (most
LANs have this). The example will configure the network parameters
automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect an evaluation board to PC
directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a
static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable a 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in
Net_Config.c configuration file. The default static IP address of this example
is set to 192.168.0.100 in Net_Config_ETH_0.h.

To test this example, download the VNC Viewer from
https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/ and run it. Enter mcbstm32f400 for the VNC
Server or the respective IP address. You'll be able to toggle the board LED
using the VNC Viewer or the graphical UI displayed on the LCD TFT.
