This is an USB Host Mass Storage and File System example.

After the USB Flash memory stick is connected it creates/overwrites 
a file with name "Test.txt" and content "USB Host Mass Storage!".

Board:                  Keil  'MCBSTM32F400'
Microcontroller:        ST       'STM32F407'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB FS CLK =  48 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
User Interface:         none
